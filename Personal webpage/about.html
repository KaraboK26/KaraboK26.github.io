              <i>
                I am a hardworking and determined Information Technology student
                with a passion for solving real-world problems and working
                towards making peopleâ€™s lives easier. In my quest to expand my
                knowledge outside of school, I have completed multiple online
                courses and had the opportunity to take part in IT bootcamps. I
                am eager and looking to learn and make an impact in the IT
                industry as a young upcoming professional.

            <p>
              I am a student doing my Bachelor's degree in Information
              Technology, eager to bring my passion for technology and
              problem-solving to a dynamic and challenging work environment.
              Throughout my studies, I honed my skills in programming languages
              such as JavaScript, HTML/CSS and C#, as well as database
              management (SQL) and software development methodologies. I have
              worked on several projects, both individually and in teams, which
              have allowed me to demonstrate my ability to learn quickly, think
              creatively, and collaborate effectively. I am motivated to
              continue growing my knowledge and skills as I take on new
              challenges in the tech industry.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong
              communicator and a proactive problem-solver. During my academic
              and extracurricular activities, I have developed the ability to
              communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical
              audiences, and to work with others to find solutions to complex
              problems. I believe that these skills, combined with my technical
              knowledge and drive to succeed, make me an excellent candidate for
              any organization looking for a dedicated and driven computer
              science professional. I am excited to begin my career and look
              forward to the opportunity to bring my skills and passion to a new
              and dynamic work environment.

                  drinking, smoking, their rights and other social
